## Project Description :page_facing_up:

### Overview

**Swanky Suite - The all-in-one WASM development tool.**

The goal of this project is to improve DEV tooling around WASM smart contracts within the Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem and make it easier for new developers coming to this space to start their projects.

There are a lot of development environments available for EVM as it is one of the earliest mainstream smart contract environments. On the other hand, we do not have enough development tools for WASM contracts or Ink! in spite of its technical superiority. Therefore, the developer engagement for WASM contracts is fairly low, especially for Substrate with Ink! as it is a very new architecture that does not justify the usage over Solidity. That is why we were motivated to create the Hardhat equivalent for the Substrate WASM contract ecosystem, but with more features.

We want to encourage more Web3 developers to use WASM by creating Swanky. Features of Swanky under the scope of this project are the following:

- Quick start a local contract development node with instant finality (Swanky Node)
- Scaffolding a new project with various templates  for both smart contracts and front-end dApp. ie. Truffle for ink!
- Compiling projects with various languages (like Ink!, Ask-Lite, …)
- Running unit tests with the Swanky Node and any other node supporting `pallet-contracts`
- Setting up RPC tests and integration tests via npm for interacting with smart contracts on the client-side
- Deploying smart contracts to networks within the Dotsama ecosystem that support `pallet-contracts`

We see Swanky Suite as the tool that enables all existing (and future) Web3 developers to have an equal experience compared to EVM dev tooling. The ultimate benefit is to have more developers who are new to WASM contract development enter the development scene in the Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem.

### Project Details

> We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project’s expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
> 

> Mockups/designs of any UI components
> 

> Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
> 

> An overview of the technology stack to be used
> 

> Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
> 

> PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
> 

> What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
> 
> - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

Swanky Suite aims to be an "all-in-one" tool for WASM smart contract developers within the Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem that bridge the various tools in the WASM ecosystem into a single interface.

**Architecture overview**

The Swanky Suite consists of two main parts, Swanky CLI and the Swanky Node.

Swanky CLI is a Node.js CLI app that uses the Polkadot.js API as its backend alongside many existing tools like the cargo contract CLI. There will be many features that will support the developer such as bootstrapping WASM dApps via smart contract and UI scaffolding, running integration tests, starting local nodes, account management, connecting and deploying contracts to both local and remote networks, compiling for various languages from a single CLI app, compatibility check from contract pallet to the compiler, and much more.

The Swanky Node will be a local developer node with an instant seal and instant finality like those of Ganache for EVM or Jupiter by Patract Labs. However, if the Substrate contract node is the place for Substrate WASM smart contract development, the Swanky Node aims to be the de facto development node for WASM smart contract development on parachains as it will be able to have customizable extrinsic profiles, where the developer can load a node with preconfigured pallets with chain extensions.

The envisioned architecture of Swanky CLI and Swanky Node (Local developer node)

**Swanky Node Features**

Swanky Node is a Substrate based blockchain configured to enable `pallet-contracts` (a smart contract module) and more features to help WASM smart contract development locally.

The Swanky Node will be available for developers as a binary release for anyone to use.

It will be possible to start the single-node development chain with a persistent state or in a non-persist mode, purging the development chain's state, and connecting with Polkadot-JS Portal front-end.

Key features of Swanky Node are:

- [pallet-contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts) and their unstable features are enabled by default.
- `instant-seal` & `manual-seal` are used instead of `grandpa` & `aura` consensus. Blocks are authored (1) as soon as a transaction gets in the pool (2) when `engine_createBlock` RPC is called. Blocks are finalized when `engine_finalizeBlock` RPC is called.
- Optimized for local development purposes by removing unnecessary components such as P2P. More features and pallets to interact with (Contract <-> Runtime) will be added.
- Access to key features of Substrate based for dApp development is available from smart contracts by implementing chain extensions for
    - Assets pallet ([https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/assets](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/assets))
    - Balances pallet
    - Contracts pallet ([https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/contracts))
    - And other custom pallets such as the dApps Staking pallet ([https://github.com/AstarNetwork/astar-frame/tree/polkadot-v0.9.24/frame/dapps-staking](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/astar-frame/tree/polkadot-v0.9.24/frame/dapps-staking))

**Sample contract templates available for scaffolding**

Swanky Suite will be shipped with a set of project templates that can be used via the Swanky init command. 

Templates will provide the full stack scaffolding including both the smart contract code as well as the front-end dApp code. This will allow the developers to jump right into development. The list of project templates will grow as new features are shipped and standards evolve, but the initial set of projects at the end of this project will be:

- "Blank" - blank smart contract project scaffolding
- "Flipper" - Flipper smart contract project scaffolding with an accompanying front-end project in React
- "PSP22" - smart contract interacting with PSP22 token scaffolding with an accompanying front-end project in React

All scaffolding projects will include unit tests where applicable.

The **Swanky tool is not:**

- An Integrated development environment (IDE)
- A compiler
- A testing framework
- A development framework or library

### Ecosystem Fit

The target audience is any existing and future WASM smart contract developers.

We want to develop Swanky to enable all existing (and future) Web3 developers to have the best possible experience when developing WASM smart contracts. In order to onboard more developers to WASM environment, dev tooling should improve and be comparatively as good as if not better than EVM dev tooling.

Swanky will become the tool for everything you need when developing WASM smart contracts for Substrate - from scaffolding to deploying on live nets. Some tools already exist and Swanky will integrate them and extend/update them if needed.  
When developing a smart contract project, each of these steps is mandatory (and should be done in the same order):

- Scaffolding new project
- Local: build debug + run unit test + deploy local + run local integration tests
- Testnet: build release + run unit test + deploy on test network (with secure account management) + run integration tests in test-network
- Mainnet: build release + run unit test (optional) + deploy on live-network (with secure account management)

The mission of Swanky is to fill those needs.

Redspot and Jupiter by Patract Labs. Both projects were the main tool for WASM smart contract development within the Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem before the Patract Labs team went into hiatus. Now there is rarely any activity in the project nor proper documentation for new developers to fully utilize the tool.

The Swanky Suite was heavily inspired by the fantastic works done by Patract Labs, and we aim to continue on what they have started but with our own uniqueness to it.

Namely, Swanky CLI adds network management, comprehensive account management, and compatibility check, and is built with an expandable code structure in mind, which is different from Redspot which is mainly a complementary tool for ink WASM development rather than an all-in-one solution.

The Swanky node has similar properties to Jupiter, but the Swanky node is focused on being the testing node for parachains, through customizable pallets with chain extensions.

## Development Status :open_book:

Swanky development plans have been communicated to the ecosystem (other parachains and Parity) during the AmsterDOT Conference in April 2022.

Swanky MVP has been demoed during Astar’s presentation at WASM Conference 2022 titled “****A hitchhiker’s guide to the WASM smart contract developer ecosystem****”. ([https://wasm-conference.com/](https://wasm-conference.com/)) as well during two workshops at Polkadot Hackathon North America 2022 ([https://polkadot-na.devpost.com/details/workshops](https://polkadot-na.devpost.com/details/workshops)) titled “**Write Deploy & Interact with ink! smart-contracts**” and “**Integrate dApp Staking chain-extension on ink! smart contract**”

MVP code is still under heavy development and will be open-sourced within Milestone 1 of the project - Swanky Beta 1 release. All details of future development are available in the Development Roadmap section.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 8 months Duration of the whole project
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 3 FTE
- **Total Costs:** *390,000 USD*

### Milestone 1

- **Estimated Duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:** 4
- **Costs:** 80,000 USD

The first milestone will cover:

- The groundwork for Swanky CLI
- A basic implementation of the essential commands for initializing and deploying a smart contract
- This milestone will be mainly worked by the Astar team

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0a. | License | All projects under the Swanky Suite will be under the MIT open source license |
| 0b. | Article/Tutorial | We will publish a Medium article and hold a recorded public tutorial/workshop that explains the benefits of Swanky and teaches the audience how to use Swanky CLI via a live demo. |
| 1. | Swanky CLI basic config file | The Swanky CLI will create a swanky.config.json which contains all the information related to the Swanky Suite (CLI and Node) and determine the current development environment for other commands to use. |
| 2. | Swanky CLI basic initialize project command (ink!) | Through Swanky CLI, developers can easily bootstrap new WASM dApp projects. Swanky CLI will provide language options. For this milestone, we will only add ink scaffolding features. |
| 3. | Swanky CLI basic compile contract command (ink!) | Developers can use Swanky CLI to compile their smart contracts into a .contract file without having to use other tools. Currently, the CLI will only support ink compilers (via cargo contract), but we will structure the project so that it is easy to expand the compiler option. |
| 4. | Swanky CLI basic account management command | Through Swanky CLI, developers can manage the signing account for deploying and making contract calls. For this milestone, we will focus on basic security (using the json account backup) for persistent accounts. |
| 5. | Swanky CLI basic contract deploy command | Developers can use Swanky CLI to deploy the compiled contract binary to the chain and get the deployed contract address. For this milestone version, we will use the cargo contract command as the base for deploying the contract. |
| 6. | Swanky CLI basic integration tests |  |

### Milestone 2

- **Estimated Duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:** 4
- **Costs:** 150,000 USD

The second milestone will cover:

| --- | --- | --- |
| 0a. | License | MIT |
| 1. | Contract dApp type generation script | Integration of Typechain to generate typed smart contracts from the sources that can be used in deploying scripts or tests. Typechain will cover most of the stuff related to interaction with blockchain and returning readable errors, results(Typechains has its own abstraction), deploying, etc. It only requires the right initialization from the Swanky. |
| 1.1. | Implement common primitives to the generated type | Implementation of popular primitives from hardhat and ethereum. Integration of primitives from Typechain. |
| 2. | Improve Swanky compile command | Speedup compilation of contracts, support of artifacts caching, optimal storage usage, add fields and arguments into swanky.config and swanky compile to manipulate the build process. |
| 3. | Swanky CLI network management command | Since developers can use Swanky CLI to deploy their dApps to remote networks, the CLI will keep a registry of networks that supports the contract pallet and configure the deploy destination. |
| 4. | Improve Swanky network and account management | Implementation of abstraction over network management, account management for integration tests, and deploying scripts. |
| 5. | Expand the Swanky test command | Implement new commands `swanky test` that allow compiling and running tests. Add the ability to run only specific tests, compile them, run without compilation, and support different modes(release, debug). |
| 6. | Swanky integration test scripts | Add a script that allows the developers to easily create integration tests for their contract which can communicate with other contracts and the UI. |

### Milestone 3

- **Estimated Duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:** 4
- **Costs:** 80,000 USD

The first milestone will cover:

| 0c. | Testing Guide | All Swanky CLI codebase will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. Documentation will contain instructions on how to run these tests. |
| 1. | Swanky CLI improved config file | The Swanky CLI will create a swanky.config.json which contains all the information related to the Swanky Suite (CLI and Node) and determine the current development environment for other commands to use. This milestone will add account storage, project environment configuration, and more. |
| 2. | Swanky CLI Initialize project command with front-end and contracts | Through Swanky CLI, developers can easily bootstrap new WASM dApp projects. This milestone will refactor the command to be modular so that it can accept additional languages (if available), and scaffold with front-end code too. |
| 3. | Swanky CLI account management command | Through Swanky CLI, developers can manage the signing account for deploying and making contract calls. This milestone will add multiple accounts, better key management, and other improvements from the previous version. |
| 4. | Swanky CLI contract deploy command | Developers can use Swanky CLI to deploy the compiled contract binary to the chain and get the deployed contract address. This milestone will refactor the deploy command to work with polkadot-js instead of wrapping the cargo contract CLI. |

### Milestone 4

- **Estimated Duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:** 4
- **Costs:** 80,000 USD

The third milestone will cover:

| 2.2. | Assets pallet chain extension | The Swanky Node will implement the assets pallet chain extension, which will allow WASM contracts to interact with the Substrate Assets pallet. |
| 3. | Swanky CLI interactive console command | Implementation of abstraction over network management, account management for integration tests, and deploying scripts. |
| 4. | Swanky CLI contract version check command | Version compatibility between the contract pallet and ink is always a problem. Swanky CLI will have a list of known compatibilities and check if the user’s current configuration is compatible or not with the chain. |
| 5. | Swanky CLI contract call command | The call command will allow the developer to directly read contract states and execute contract functions. |

## Future Plans

Our plan is to continuously develop and maintain Swanky and promote it to Web3 developers at relevant offline and online events such as hackathons, workshops, and conferences with the goal of growing the WASM smart contract DEV community.

In terms of features, we will work on the following:

- Add a Relaychain-Parachain environment setup like zomebienet to the Swanky Node so developers can test XCM with other pallets through WASM smart contracts.
- Add parachain profiles so other parachain projects can contribute to their implementation of chain extensions for custom pallets which can allow WASM contracts to interact with them directly.
- Add custom plugin support to extend the functionality.

Astar is a multi-chain smart contract platform that supports multiple blockchains and virtual machines. We strongly believe that WASM is the future of smart contracts and dApps we will continue with our efforts in making WASM on Polkadot and Kusama the go-to place for Web3 developers. This can be achieved by offering the developer community the best experience possible which includes both the technology stack but also the tools such as Swanky.

Swanky CLI is designed in a modular way and open-sourced, so anyone is welcome to contribute, develop and extend the tooling.
